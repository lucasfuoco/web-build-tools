- Fix annoyance where "rush update" (formerly "rush generate") would always change the integrity hash for tarball entries in shrinkwrap.yaml
- Fix an issue where Rush's .npmrc configuration was not honored when spawned via an NPM lifecycle script; in general the process environment is now more isolated
- Rush now warns when phantom node_modules folders are found
- Relax the rush.json version check for rush-lib; future versions are now accepted as long as the major/minor parts match

- Improve "rush check" to ignore peer dependencies, since they don't need to be consistent with everything else (and generally won't be)
- (Breaking change) Replace pinned-versions.json with a more general common-versions.json that can track other cross-project dependency versions

## 4.3.3
Thu, 31 May 2018 21:57:13 GMT

### Updates

- Remove the old undocumented "rush purge" command, since it conflicts with Rush 5

## 4.3.2
Mon, 26 Mar 2018 19:12:42 GMT

### Updates

- Change *.d.ts file path for rush-lib
- Add "ignoreMissingScript" flag to custom command and fix other minor issues
- Add --pack option to "rush publish" to support packing packages into tarballs instead of publishing to NPM registry
- Upgrade colors to version ~1.2.1

## 4.3.1
Tue, 20 Mar 2018 20:02:56 GMT

### Updates

- Add support for overriding the default windows parallelism with 'max'.
- Remove IPackageJson API. Consumers should now use the equivalent definition from @microsoft/node-core-library instead.
- Move the environment checks from rush-lib to rush
- Fix an annoyance where common/temp/shrinkwrap.yaml was formatted in a way that made diffs less readable

## 4.3.0
Fri, 02 Mar 2018 02:45:37 GMT

### Updates

- Fix an issue where we always deleted the pnpm store. This is not necessary since the store is transactional. We should only delete the store if it is a --clean install.
- Fix an issue where the package manager installation could get corrupted if the Rush tool was accidentally invoked multiple times concurrently.
- Fix issue with pnpm where store was not removed after an unsuccessful installation
- When Rush links PNPM packages to their dependencies, it should link to the realpath, rather than linking to the symlink. This will improve performance of builds by reducing the number of file system reads that are needed.
- Update Rush to consider the shrinkwrap file during incremental builds.
- Add a --changed-projects-only flag to 'rush build', which will skip rebuilding of downstream packages. It will only rebuild projects that change, but not their dependents.
- Add a locking mechanism around certain rush commands so only one process can be working in a Rush repository at a single point in time. This is useful for commands that may corrupt each other, like generate, install, link, and rebuild.
- When using pnpm, Rush will check and see if other projects are using a dependency and will re-use it if possible. This way, a user will not have to run "rush generate" if they are adding a dependency that is already being used elsewhere in the monorepo.
- Add a notice for unsupported versions of NodeJS runtime
- Add a new command-line flag "--conservative" which causes "rush generate" to perform a minimal upgrade
- Improved "rush generate" so that if interrupted, it does not leave you with a deleted shrinkwrap.yaml; the new integrity checks eliminate the need for this, and it was annoying
- Fix Rush version increase logic to handle cyclic dependencies properly

## 4.2.5
Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:36:51 GMT

### Updates

- Fix an issue when parsing scoped peer dependencies in the pnpm shrinkwrap file
